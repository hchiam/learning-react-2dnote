# Learning react 2DNote

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Practice React by incorporating my _2DNote project

You can generate a [dependency graph](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-dependency-cruiser) with `bash show_dep_graph.sh`.

```bash
npm install
```

just once, and then

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

or

```bash
npm run fast
```
