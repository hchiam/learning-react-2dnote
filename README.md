# Learning react 2DNote

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Practice React by incorporating my _2DNote project.

- https://github.com/hchiam/learning-reactjs/blob/master/index.html
- https://github.com/hchiam/learning-reactjs/blob/master/index.js
- https://github.com/hchiam/_2DNote/blob/master/_2DNote.js

This React web app makes use of my _2DNote sonification side-project via `npm install 2dnote` or `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hchiam/_2DNote@1.8.0/_2DNote.min.js"></script>`

```bash
npm install
```

just once, and then

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

or

```bash
npm run fast
```

By the way, you can generate a [dependency graph](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-dependency-cruiser) with `bash show_dep_graph.sh`.
